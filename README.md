# Local-RAG-with-LangChain
This project implements a local QA system by combining RAG  with LangChain. LangChain's library assists in building the RAG pipeline, which leverages a powerful LLM  hosted on OLLAMA. Notably, this system operates entirely on your local machine, offering privacy and control over your data.
